Design Concept

For my final project, I will be building a website for my friend, LaNicia, and her soul food company 
(Coastal Soul) that's based in Cannon Beach, Oregon. 

After consulting with LaNicia, we decided to use WordPress to build the site, because she's used WordPress before
therefore it would be easier for her to be able to take over the maintanence of the site. Additionally, she
is considering adding a blog to her page, and WordPress would be very easy to add and maintain a blog. She has
picked the "zeeTasty" WordPress theme, which I have tried to replicate the look of in my wireframe.

I will use a third-party mapping API to add an interactive map of Cannon Beach (probably GoogleMaps), 
the location of her business. And I will use jQuery to build a form for prospective clients to request a price estimate. 

I need to discuss this with her, but I might see if we can look into adding something like the PayPal API so that she can
accept payment for her catering services online.
